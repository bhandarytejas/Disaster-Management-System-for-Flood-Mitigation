# Twitter Disaster Management
Twitter is the online news and social networking service on which users regularly post and interact with messages which has enabled people to express what they see and feel in their surroundings.

At present, I have mined the tweets using Twitter API for Hurricane Sandy and plotted on an interactive map for the affected states against time. 

I intend to analyse the tweets further to get the extend of the flood by keyword and apply clustering to get the extent of the flood along with the disaster prone areas. Analyzing the tweets further can give us the areas that had been severly hit. Further, I intend to incorporate tweets for disasters like Hurricane Harvey and Irma to compare the recent flood response status. Machine learning techniques can be used to make predictions of areas that are flood prone by analyzing the landscape elevation.

Please find the interactive plots in the below link:
